<p>Following the success of the <a href="https://claritychallenge.org/clarity2021-workshop/">1st</a>, <a href="https://claritychallenge.org/clarity2022-workshop/">2nd</a> and <a href="https://claritychallenge.org/clarity2022-CEC2-workshop/">3rd</a> Clarity Workshop, we are now pleased to announce the 4th Clarity Workshop for Machine Learning Challenges for Hearing Aids, to be collocated with Interspeech 2023, Dublin, Ireland.</p>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>One of the biggest challenges for hearing-impaired listeners is understanding speech in the presence of background noise. Everyday social noise levels can have a devastating impact on speech intelligibility. Inability to communicate effectively can lead to social withdrawal and isolation. Disabling hearing impairment affects 360 million people worldwide, with that number increasing because of the ageing population. Unfortunately, current hearing aid technology is often ineffective in noisy situations. Although amplification can restore audibility, it does not compensate fully for the effects of hearing loss.</p>

<p>Recent advances in hearing aid hardware are presenting opportunities for increasingly sophisticated processing and machine learning solutions. For example, wireless communication between the hearing aid and a mobile device can allow non-latency critical computation to be freed from the low-power constraints attendant with traditional aids. These advances raise the prospect that the computationally demanding techniques employed with great success in statistical speech modelling and statistical acoustic scene analysis could soon be exploited for hearing aid processing. We believe that new directions in hearing aid research can be inspired by bringing together speech technologists and hearing researchers. The Clarity workshops are designed to stimulate a two-way conversation between the speech research community and hearing aid developers. Hearing aid developers, who are not typically represented at Interspeech, will have an opportunity to present the challenges of their industry to the speech community; the speech community will be able to present and discuss potentially transformative approaches to speech in noise processing in the presence of hearing researchers and industry experts.</p>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<p>Any work related to the challenges of hearing aid signal processing will be considered relevant
The aim of this virtual workshop is to report on the Clarity Enhancement Challenge, the first ever machine learning challenge targeted at helping those with a hearing impairment. The challenge was launched at the start of 2021, and is seeking to find new approaches to signal processing in hearing aids.</p>

<ul>
<li>Binaural technology for speech enhancement and source separation</li>
<li>Multi-microphone processing technology</li>
<li>Real-time approaches to speech enhancement</li>
<li>Statistical model-driven approaches to hearing aid processing</li>
<li>Audio quality & intelligibility assessment hearing aid and cochlear implant users</li>
<li>Efficient and effective integration of psychoacoustic testing in machine learning</li>
<li>Machine learning for diverse target listeners</li>
<li>Machine learning models of hearing impairment</li>
</ul>

<h2>The 2nd Clarity Prediction Challenge</h2>

<p>
The Clarity-2023 will also host the 2nd Clarity Prediction Challenge, that is tacking the problem of developing new intrusive and non-intrusive approaches to hearing-aid speech intelligibility prediction. The Challenge will be launching on 1st March, is you may be interested in participating please sign up to our Google group for further announcements.
